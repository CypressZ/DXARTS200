  <p>The owners let you in and welcomed you. </p>
  <p>After using the bathroom you're intrigued by one photo on their wall, a house 
    that looks similar in shape, but very different from the one you're in right now: </p>

    <p>The owner saw you and explained that it's a old yaodong/cave from their culture. </p>
    <p>"Although we did keep on feature -- the traditional fireplace is too precious to be removed, 
        and it always warm up the whole house."
        The owner leads you to their fireplace... </p>
